## The Problem

Students spend impulsively on small purchases — coffee, fast food, streaming — without realising how much those micro-transactions add up. Traditional savings tools require discipline and large deposits, creating a barrier for students with irregular incomes and no financial literacy.

---

## Our Solution

**CoinStash** is a fintech tool that automatically rounds up every digital transaction and invests the spare change into a low-risk, blockchain-secured educational fund.

> *Spend ₹47 on chai? We round it up to ₹50 and save ₹3 — silently, automatically, and with a multiplier if you spent on fast food.*

### Key Features

- **Smart Round-Up Engine** — category-based multipliers (Fast Food 2×, Entertainment 2×, Education 0.5×) applied automatically on every transaction
- **Trust Score System** — a 0–1000 decentralised credibility score based on savings frequency, volume, streaks, and lesson completion. Powers micro-loan and grant eligibility
- **Blockchain Vault** — funds locked in a Solidity smart contract (Hardhat/local testnet) with penalty-free withdrawal for verified educational expenses
- **AI Nudge Agent** — OpenAI-powered agent that sends behavioural nudges based on spending patterns
- **MicroLearn Streak System** — financial literacy lessons unlocked by Trust Score milestones, each worth +20 points
- **Live Dashboard** — real-time savings tracker, transaction ledger, category breakdown, savings growth chart, and vault progress
